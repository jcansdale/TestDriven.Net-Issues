# TestDriven.Net Issues

I'm experimenting using this repository for public issue tracking. The rest of TestDriven.Net is managed inside a private repository, but unfortunately there isn't the option to make those issues public. I'm tracking a few issues here instead.

Feel free to add issues, feature suggestions or tweet me!
