# TestDriven.Net

## The latest build of TestDriven.Net 4.0-alpha is available here: http://testdriven.net/download.aspx

### It includes support for .NET Core and Visual Studio "15" preview versons. It is "alpha" in the sense that it's feature incomplete, not that it will take your firstborn. :wink: Please give it a try and report and issues you find. I want to make it as useful as possible.

### You can read the release notes here: http://testdriven.net/downloads/releasenotes.html

I'm experimenting using this repository for public issue tracking. The rest of TestDriven.Net is managed inside a private repository, but unfortunately there isn't the option to make those issues public. I'm tracking a few issues here instead.

Feel free to add issues, feature suggestions or tweet me!
