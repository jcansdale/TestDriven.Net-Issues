I'm experimenting using this repository for public issue tracking. The rest of TestDriven.Net is managed inside a private repository, but unfortunately there isn't the option to make those issues public. I'm tracking a few issues here instead.

Feel free to add [issues](https://twitter.com/jcansdale), feature [suggestions](https://twitter.com/jcansdale) or tweet me!
